    Facciamo una prova: Hi all! I am Giovanni welcome to My Website! Here my life in a nutshell! Here you can find some info about me, my work and my activities. If none of those sutisfy you, or you need more info or reach me, here you find my contacts. Hi, I am Giovanni, a PhD student at Università degli studi di Brescia. I define myself an experimentalist particle physicist. Besides physics and machine learning, I get interested in more or less everything I see and hear. Sometimes I try to carry on some of these interests and sometimes they become real passions. At the moment I am really into woodworking and more in general into DIY projects. I also love photography and when I have time I try to improve my photographer skills a little bit. I really like chess and board games in general. Finally when I have some free weekend I grab my rope and I go climbing.
